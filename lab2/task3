Task 3: What are the hardware differences between MuxCase and MuxLookup.

                                Answer :
    "Firstly MuxCase have 2 paramters whereas MuxLookup have 3 paramters.
    In MuxCase first parameter is about boolean value it means that if we
    have not a true value in a given statement so the given boolean value 
    will be shown in output and the second parameter we have of name as Array
    and in this section we have to write an statement if this state is run 
    which the output we have given, this is about Muxcase. 
    In Muxlookup first parameter about a variable , second is boolean value
    work same as in Muxcase, third paramter is an Array and in this array we
    have to just access the pin numbers, that at what pin number we have to
                            show the output.
                This is the difference in MuxCase and in Mux-Lookuo
